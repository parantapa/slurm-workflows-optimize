class OptimizationStudy:
    """One space to optimize, and everything needed to optimize it.

    name: keys its results,
        and must match the name the results files hold its observations under.
    objective: the search minimizes it.
        Its argument names must match the keys of `space`,
        and it returns a mapping carrying `objective_key`.
    objective_queue: where the evaluations run, one task per point.
    optimizer_queue: where the model fit and the acquisition optimization run,
        one task per round.
        Its workers need botorch.
        The objective's workers do not.
    search_parallelism: points evaluated per round.
        When None, the count comes from the search.

    The search runs between `min_search_rounds`
    and `max_search_rounds` rounds.
    It stops early when it no longer improves:

    min_search_rounds: rounds that always run.
        Stalled rounds below it count toward patience.
        But they cannot end the search.
    max_search_rounds: hard ceiling.
        The search runs at least one round, even when this is 0.
    patience: consecutive stalled rounds that end the search.
        A round that improves resets the count.
    min_improvement: fraction of the incumbent's magnitude
        a round must beat it by.
        A smaller gain counts as a stall.

    objective_key: the key of the result to minimize.
        The search records every other key and does not model it.

    The rest tune the fit and the acquisition optimization:

    num_restarts: multi-start count for the acquisition optimization.
    raw_samples: candidates drawn to pick those starting points from.
    mc_samples: quasi-MC draws used to estimate the acquisition value
        at a candidate.
    acqf_timeout_s: wall-clock budget for the gradient optimization
        in one propose step.
        Drawing the `raw_samples` candidates is outside it.
        A timeout is not an error.
        The step returns the best candidates so far.

    extra_objective_kwargs: must not shadow a parameter of the space.
    priority: the priority of every task this study submits,
        the fits as well as the evaluations.
        The server dispatches the highest priority first.
