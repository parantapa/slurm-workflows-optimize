# `OptimizeSpaceBotorch`

[<- back to the main README](../../README.md)

`slurm_workflows_optimize.optimize_space_botorch`:
the batch Bayesian search, its study dataclass, and its settings.

## `OptimizeSpaceBotorch(studies, executor, files, search_parallelism=None)`

```python
from slurm_workflows_optimize import OptimizationStudy, OptimizeSpaceBotorch

opt = OptimizeSpaceBotorch(studies, executor, files, search_parallelism=None)
```

Fits a Gaussian process to everything measured so far,
asks it for a batch of points at once, evaluates that batch, and repeats.
It needs botorch, which is an optional dependency.
The package's `botorch` extra installs it,
and the README's [Installation](../../README.md#installation) section covers that.
`OptimizeSpaceBotorch` and `OptimizationStudy` import from the package root.
The package resolves them on first use rather than at import time,
so `import slurm_workflows_optimize` still works without botorch installed.

`studies` is a list, as for an exploration.
`OptimizeSpaceBotorch` searches several spaces in the same rounds,
and each drops out when it meets its own stopping rule.

It never explores.
`files` are results files to start from,
which `ExploreSpaceSobolQMC.save` or this class's own `save` wrote,
in the format of [the results file](results-file.md).
`OptimizeSpaceBotorch` models a study
on the observations they hold under its name,
so an optimization study must carry the name its exploration ran under.
A resumed run takes the exploration file and every search file written since.
See [How to resume a search](../how-to-guides/resume-a-search.md).

A study with nothing under its name in any file is an error.
`OptimizeSpaceBotorch` re-checks the points against the space the study declares.
It reports a parameter missing, one too many,
or a range since narrowed past a saved point,
rather than fit on them.

The objective contract is the same for `ExploreSpaceSobolQMC` and `OptimizeSpaceBotorch`:
see [The objective](objective.md).
What a failed evaluation does to a run is the same too:
see [Failures](objective.md#failures).

## `OptimizationStudy`

The exploration study's fields, minus the design ones, plus the search:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name`, `space`, `objective`, `objective_queue` | | As for `ExplorationStudy`. The value is minimized. |
| `optimizer_queue` | | Queue the model fit and the propose step run on, one task per round. |
| `search_parallelism` | | Points evaluated per round. Optional if the search carries a default. |
| `min_search_rounds` | `5` | Rounds that always run. |
| `max_search_rounds` | `30` | Hard ceiling on rounds. It must be at least `min_search_rounds`, or construction raises `ValueError`. The search runs at least one round, even at `0`. |
| `patience` | `3` | Consecutive rounds without improvement that end the search. |
| `min_improvement` | `0.05` | Fraction a round must beat the incumbent by to count as improving. |
| `objective_key` | `"objective"` | Which entry of the result is minimized. |
| `num_restarts`, `raw_samples`, `mc_samples`, `acqf_timeout_s` | See below | Tuning for the propose step. See [Tuning the propose step](#tuning-the-propose-step). |
| `extra_objective_kwargs` | `{}` | Extra arguments passed to the objective and not varied. |
| `priority` | `0.0` | The priority of every task the study submits, fits and evaluations alike. The highest priority runs first. |

### Tuning the propose step

Four study arguments tune the acquisition optimization.
They are settings of one run.
`OptimizeSpaceBotorch` keeps them on the study and passes them to every fit:

| Argument | Default | What it controls |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `num_restarts` | `10` | Multi-start count for the acquisition optimization. |
| `raw_samples` | `128` | Candidates drawn to pick those starting points from. |
| `mc_samples` | `128` | Quasi-MC draws per acquisition evaluation. |
| `acqf_timeout_s` | `10.0` | Wall-clock budget for the gradient optimization in one propose step. Drawing the `raw_samples` candidates is outside it. The step can hit it without an error: what comes back is a full batch, finite and inside the bounds, less thoroughly optimized. |

```python
OptimizationStudy(..., num_restarts=20, acqf_timeout_s=60.0)
```

## Methods

| Method | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `run()` | Runs rounds until every study stops, by its patience or its ceiling. |
| `best_point(name)` | `(params, value)` of the best point the study knows, files included. |
| `best_output(name)` | The objective's whole result at that point. |
| `observations(name)`, `num_observations(name)` | What the study's model is fit on, and how much of it. |
| `dim(name)` | How many dimensions a study's space has. |
| `save(path)` | Writes this run's points to a gzipped pickle. |

```python
opt = OptimizeSpaceBotorch(
    [OptimizationStudy("demo", SPACE, objective, "cpu", "opt", 40)],
    executor,
    ["explore.pkl.gz"],
)
opt.run()
opt.save("search.pkl.gz")

params, value = opt.best_point("demo")
```

`save` writes only what this instance evaluated,
so an earlier file passed alongside it counts every point once.

## Attributes

| Attribute | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `results[name]` | The points this instance evaluated, as lists. `save` writes the same set. |
| `prior[name]` | What the files held, in the same shape as `results[name]`. |
| `studies` | The study list with the parallelism filled in. |

`best_point` and `observations` cover both `results` and `prior`.

## What a round is

`run()` starts rounds until the search stops improving.
Each round fits a `SingleTaskGP` to every point measured so far.
Then it asks `qLogNoisyExpectedImprovement` for the whole batch in one call,
submits all of it, and waits.
It chooses the batch jointly rather than a point at a time.

`qLogNoisyExpectedImprovement` reads its incumbent off the posterior
at the points already evaluated.
The model carries every point measured so far, so a fit costs more every round.

A second call to `run()` starts another set of rounds.
The new rounds model everything the earlier calls measured.

The run reports itself as it goes.
It gives the best point after every round,
how long each fit and each propose step took,
and why a study stopped.

Why a round chooses the whole batch at once,
and why the fit runs on a worker,
is in [Batch Bayesian optimization](../explanation/batch-bayesian-optimization.md).

## When it stops

A round is *stalled* when it fails to improve the best value by `min_improvement`,
a fraction of the incumbent's magnitude.
A round that does not lower the best value is always stalled.
Against a best value of exactly 0, any decrease counts as improving.
`patience` stalled rounds in a row end the search,
and an improving round resets the streak.

`min_search_rounds` is a floor on rounds *run*, not on rounds counted.
A stalled round below it still counts toward `patience`,
but it cannot be the round that ends the search.
The earliest stop is therefore `max(min_search_rounds, patience)` rounds.
A search that never improves stops there exactly,
unless `max_search_rounds` is lower and stops it first.
`max_search_rounds` stops the search even while it still improves.
Each stalled round reports how far it has to go,
under whichever bound is further away.

## Where the work runs

Nothing heavy runs on the driver.
A round is two kinds of task on two queues.
`OptimizeSpaceBotorch` submits each kind for every study at once,
and waits for it once:

| Queue | Tasks per round | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `objective_queue` | `search_parallelism` evaluations | whatever the objective needs |
| `optimizer_queue` | one fit-and-propose: the GP fit and the acquisition optimization | botorch, cores, and memory for a GP over every point measured so far |

Both can point at one queue, and that cannot deadlock,
because a round never has both kinds pending at once.

botorch must be importable on the driver
and in the `optimizer_queue` workers' environment.
Where botorch does not import on a compute node without extra setup,
the `setup_script` of the job group that serves `optimizer_queue`
activates that environment.
Workers that serve only `objective_queue` need neither botorch nor torch.
A fit that fails to import botorch raises on the driver and names the queue.
The traceback is in a worker log under `executor.work_dir`.
